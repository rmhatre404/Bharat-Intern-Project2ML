As part of my data science coursework, I completed a machine learning project on the Titanic dataset to predict the survival of passengers based on various features. I pre-processed the dataset to handle missing values and categorical variables, and trained several machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest. I evaluated the performance of each algorithm using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, and selected the best performing algorithm for hyperparameter tuning using Cross-validation. The final model achieved an accuracy of 76.7% on the test dataset, indicating its effectiveness in predicting the survival of passengers on the Titanic.
